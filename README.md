1. Download Zip File (Code - Download Zip File)
2. Unzip the folder (project_animations-main)
3. One you open the folder in the step 2 your can see 3 folders. (Points= 4,5 and 6) 
4. The first folder you can see 2 demos (A.tkinter and B.1_actual_example) and (the SNAKE Game created using Tkinter). 
5. The second folder called (2.Game_World and characters) you can see a folder from where i tool the ideas (Folder called Idea generation - Mario Game). In the same folder, 2.Game_World and characters, you can see the code of Python of all the characters created in python and finally a pdf of the characters done manually in a piece of paper and colors.
6. In the third main folder (3. M00763709_Carlos_Software_project_Assessment) you can find the Interface_Code_MainCode.py and the 8 Animations created all of them with Python and simulating with (Simulator_Fadecandy) and import the opc.py(library)

7. To check the main code and interface of the 8 animations which I created ising Python and commented you have to open the (Interface_Code_MainCode.py) and Using values from 1 to 8 you can play with the animations 1 by 1.
8. After you finish with 1 animation in the (Python 3.9.0 Shell) will ask you if you would like to continue watching the animations typing YES (in capital letters)
9. All the Animations have comments which will be helpful to know what does that line in concret which you would like to see.

During the whole code created in the interface (Interface_Code_MainCode.py) I used While loops, While true loops, Loops, functions to call, time, time.sleep, Lists, counters, inputs which you have to have information to code.

This code have to the planned to have a good code and improve every single time depends on what the person which is coding want to do. I used a grid done in a document word which after I printed to have and code from the paper and apply that information and used in the program of Python.
